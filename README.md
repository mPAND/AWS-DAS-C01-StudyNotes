# AWS-DAS-C01-StudyNotes
Open Guide for **AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty (DAS-C01)** Exam

## Introduction
The AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty (DAS-C01) examination is intended for individuals who perform in a
data analytics-focused role. This exam validates an examinee’s comprehensive understanding of using AWS
services to design, build, secure, and maintain analytics solutions that provide insight from data.

It validates an examinee’s ability to:
* Define AWS data analytics services and understand how they integrate with each other.
* Explain how AWS data analytics services fit in the data lifecycle of collection, storage, processing, and
visualization.

## Recommended AWS Knowledge

* A minimum of 5 years of experience with common data analytics technologies
* At least 2 years of hands-on experience working on AWS
* Experience and expertise working with AWS services to design, build, secure, and maintain analytics
solutions

## Exam Content

Legend
------

-	📒 Marks standard/official AWS pages and docs
-	🔹 Important or often overlooked tip
-	❗ “Serious” gotcha (used where risks or time or resource costs are significant: critical security risks, mistakes with significant financial cost, or poor architectural choices that are fundamentally difficult to correct)
-	🔸 “Regular” gotcha, limitation, or quirk (used where consequences are things not working, breaking, or not scaling gracefully)
-	📜 Undocumented feature (folklore)
-	🐥 Relatively new (and perhaps immature) services or features
-	⏱ Performance discussions
-	⛓ Lock-in: Products or decisions that are likely to tie you to AWS in a new or significant way — that is, later moving to a non-AWS alternative would be costly in terms of engineering effort
-	🚪 Alternative non-AWS options
-	💸 Cost issues, discussion, and gotchas
-	🕍 A mild warning attached to “full solution” or opinionated frameworks that may take significant time to understand and/or might not fit your needs exactly; the opposite of a point solution (the cathedral is a nod to [Raymond’s metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)\)
-	📗📘📙 Colors indicate basics, tips, and gotchas, respectively.
-	🚧 Areas where correction or improvement are needed (possibly with link to an issue — do help!)
